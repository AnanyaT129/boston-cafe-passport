Instructions for running the script:

FIRST TIME RUNNING PYTHON FIREBASE SCRIPT:
------------------------------------------
1. Log into firebase project dashboard and go to Project Settings
2. Under "Service Accounts" generate a new key for PYTHON
3. Move that JSON file to the /scripts folder in this project and rename it "credentials"
4. VERY IMPORTANT: ENSURE THIS FILE IS IN .gitignore. DO NOT PUSH THIS FILE TO THE REPOSITORY

TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
------------------
1. Download data in Google Sheets "Visited" tab as .csv
2. Clean up the data by removing all the empty rows and renaming any fields that need to be renamed
3. Copy data into the "cafeDataInput.csv" file
4. Run the uploadCsvToFirestore.py file and ensure printed outputs and Firestore data look okay

NOTE: this script will not replace an existing record for a cafe. Delete all potential duplicates first.
